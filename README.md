# Object-Oriented-Programming
This OOP challenge requires:

3 classes be created: Body; Input; Output. The classes need to go in their corresponding files: Body.js; Input.js; Output.js.
The Body class needs to instantiate Input class and Output class, and connect Input to Output
The Input class needs to create an input box and a button. The input should be an URL and it should pass it to a callback when the user clicks the button
The Output class needs to have an 'url' property that when set, will asynchronously XMLHttpRequest/AJAX the URL and set the contents to the tag.
The Body class needs to pass the value from the input callback to the output's 'url' property
The code tag text needs to be purple by using a CSS class.
This challenge is framed in jquery, but jquery usage is not a requirement. This Instructions class can be used as an example on how to create a class. ajax.txt is included to be used with the ajax call. Chrome has issues with AJAXing local files, better to use FireFox.
